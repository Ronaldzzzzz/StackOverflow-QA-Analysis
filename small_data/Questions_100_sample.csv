So far, I have mostly used scripts, functions, and structures for econometric analysis; importing and reformatting data from Excel (with some tolerance to non-standardised formatting of the Excel file); estimating a variety of models (whose specification at times differs only by a single parameter); creating and exporting figures, etc.</p>

<p>I am interested in the OOP paradigm because I have the impression that it may clean up my work space and reduce redundancy. However, all examples I have encountered pertain to applications that allow for a straightforward identification of which ""objects in the real world"" can be implemented as instances of a class in OOP. For econometrics, data analysis, and the like, I don't fully understand where the benefits of OOP would come in. I don't even know what would be the objects in my workflow (apart from the obvious model objects, which could just as well be structures).</p>

<p>If someone could outline whether and how OOP is applicable and valuable to an econometrics or general data analysis workflow, that would help me a lot.</p>

While installing i get the default forms (apppool, appname, website), some pre-defined custom forms and some selfmade custom forms.
Now while installation i add some data in the registry.</p>

<p>I have only one problem: TARGETSITE property.
This property is filled by default form (Context.Parameters[""TargetSite""] is something like ""/LM/W3SVC/1"" for defaultWebSite) and its value properly added to the registry.
Everthing is fine until i use the repair function...</p>

<p>Whilst repairing, the first few default forms will be skipped by installation, therefore the TARGETSITE property will be empty (Context.Parameters[""Targetsite""] is """").
Sadly i can not interfere with that to get the needed value from registry where i added it for exactly that reason.
Because the registry values will be updated before custom code is triggered in the ""override Install"" method.
Even onBeforeInstall is fired after the registry has been updated.</p>

<p>If a rollback is done, while repairing, the registry key will be reset to the correct value before, so i have to believe, that somehow i can access this value from within my custom action code.</p>

However, it seems there are quite some exceptions that can occur, so right now I have a huge try/catch block around every line calling back to the client, ending with disabling of the event in case any exception occurs. Besides being cumbersome to write every time, <strong>I'm not sure if I could simplify the try catch block by catching just a few base exceptions?</strong> Right now I don't really care what's causing the exceptions (I don't care whether it's faulted, aborted, disposed or timed out) but I do log the different exceptions.</p>

<p><strong>I also read about IErrorHandler, but will that actually be suitable when invoking a method on the client?</strong></p>

<p>Here's a sample of my current strategy:</p>

<pre><code>    private void OnProductChanged(List&lt;DTO&gt; products)
    {
        try
        {
            client.OnProductChanged(products);
            return;
        }
        catch (TimeoutException)
        {
            log.Info(""Communication to client timed out."");
        }
        catch (CommunicationObjectAbortedException)
        {
            log.Info(""Connection to client is in aborted state."");
        }
        catch (CommunicationObjectFaultedException)
        {
            log.Info(""Connection to client is in faulted state."");
        }
        catch (CommunicationException ce)
        {
            log.InfoFormat(""CommunicationException occured on product change notification: {0}."", ce.Message);
        }
        catch (ObjectDisposedException)
        {
            log.Info(""Communication channel is disposed."");
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            log.WarnFormat(""Unhandled {0} on client callback: {1}"", e.GetType(), e.Message);
        }

        SendProductChanged = false;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>SendProductChanged = false;</code> line will take care of unbinding the event handler.</p>

Let's say I register a new user in the site. That user get's a new email with a link to click. When the user clicks that link it takes him in the confirm page. There the user clicks the confirm button and users email is confirmed. </p>

<p>The problem is that as as a side effect the user is also logged in. I don't want that. This only happens only the first time I visit that page. If I visit that page again and confirms the email the user does not log in automatically. </p>

<p>My question is how can I prevent the user log in even in the first time he confirms the email. I searched the documentation but couldn't not find any setting to prevent this. Also I looked in the source code of ConfirmEmailView and I can't see a way to turn off this behavior besides manually commenting this line </p>

<p>I think I found a workaround to the problem without having to fork or whatever. I just copied that class in my own views file trying to make sure I also imported all the other dependencies that are needed. Then I just deleted that call on login and the function that it calls. I hope I did a good job with that. After that in my urls.py, right before the imports for allauth, I copied the line that is used for confirm-email and redirected it to my own view. And now it looks like this</p>

I'm trying to set left/right margins like the attached picture. I succeeded to implement it by adding UITextView to UIScrollView.
However, I could achieve almost everything I want with UITextView alone. For example, with UIScrollView, when I manually change the text of UITextView, it automatically scrolls to bottom regardless of setting its .scrollEnabled to No. </p>

<p>It would be perfect if a scroll indicator of UITextView appears outside UITextView.
In the attached picture, let's say the red box represents the entire UITextView. I tried to change UITextView's scrollIndicatorInsets property, but a scroll indicator can be moved only inward to be visible.</p>

<p>Several apps such as Pages, aWriter, Plaintext achieve this feature.
Could you give any suggestion?</p>

Consider the case of a bug fix which causes a small change in the expected output, forcing a minor change in the test suite.  It is extremely convenient to have both changes in the same commit, since it makes it obvious to the reviewer exactly what is changed in the output.  On the other hand,  sometimes you might just want to view the diffs to the source, or the diffs to the expected output and it is much easier to do that if the commits are separate.  Also, the two things are logically distinct so it makes sense to make distinct commits.</p>

<p>I would love to be able to make two distinct commits, but somehow have the two commits linked together in some way (so that I can cherry-pick, revert, etc. both commits as an atomic unit).
Also, if two distinct commits are made, then the test suite will fail on the first commit (unless a third commit is introduced to relax the test suite), making future bisects a pain.   The issue of future bisects failing generally encourages me to make a single commit, but commits should be logically distinct units and a commit to code is logically distinct from a commit to the expected output in the test suite.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make two distinct commits and not have to bend over backwards to prevent bisect from failing on one of them?  (eg, having to explicitly mention commits to skip)</p>

336038,12071390,1249066.0,2012-08-22T10:45:34Z,,1,DB connection InfoMessage callback not firing immediately for stored proc print statements,"<p>I have several long running Sybase stored procedures with print statements that output progress messages. We've always executed these SPs using isql or manually through aseisql or sqladvantage (all sybase specific tools). These tools correctly display the print messages as soon as they are output by the SP as the SPs all contain ""set flushmessage on"". </p>

<p>I've written a C# console wrapper app which generically executes a procedure and transforms the results. However frustratingly I have been unable to capture the print messages and write them out to std out. This seems like it should be trivial and I'm amazed I cant turn up much on it on the internet.</p>

<p>I'm using an ODBC connection and am adding the necessary event handler to the InfoMessage callback hook. In my testing, this is getting called with the print statement messages - <em>however not in realtime as they are issued</em>. It doesn't seem to get called until a resultset is sent back to the client, then it is called once only with all messages. I've tried using a DataAdapter to fill a DataSet, using ExecuteNonQuery, ExecuteReader and so on and it doesn't seem to change the behaviour. I've also tried both the Sybase System 11 and Adaptive Server Enterprise ODBC drivers and no difference.</p>

<p>So my question is twofold:</p>

<p>1) firstly I'd like to understand exactly what is occuring here - I know the stored procedure is immediately sending the message to the database server but it's obviously being cached somewhere - either not read off the server by the ODBC driver or read and cached in the driver memory itself? - Normally I just think of the calling thread in my app blocking on a database call, but trying to think through what's really going on I guess the thread is busy within the driver code polling for results/messages and I don't know how that kind of works in with the callback function and when that is processed. Debugging in my app it seems to be called just before I get control back to process results.</p>

<p>2) Secondly, what I'd really like to know is whether there is any way to change the behaviour so the messages are sent back to the client immediately.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, but please refrain from ""why don't you do things XYZ way instead"" suggestions as I'm really after specific help solving and understanding this problem -I can think of many alternatives should the issue prove to be insurmountable.</p>

<p>Here's a little test-rig to illutsrate the code:</p>

<p>Stored proc:</p>

<pre><code>create procedure sp_test
as
begin
    set flushmessage on

    print ""Step 1""

    waitfor delay ""00:00:10""

    print ""Step 2""

    waitfor delay ""00:00:10""

    select 10 as ""number""  -- preferably put some sort of select from a table here

    print ""Final Step""

The map will eventually have around 200 millions of values.</p>

<p>The problem is that While inserting, I have to first check if the key is existed in the map, if true, get all values stored in a temp collection then add the new integer to the collection and put them back to map, or instantiate a new collection with a new integer.</p>

<p>This is so slow when I get to the point where a collection contains around 50000 integers. I usually got a java out of heap space error.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get rid of the get process? where I only check for the key existence and then immediately add the value to the existed collection, something like posh to a stack, especially that the map is in the memory, or is it what makes the difference between Java and C++, where in C++ I can benefit from using pointers?</p>

<p>I have been scouring the web and recognize that the Date class is not dependent on time-zones... I feel like this is a result of the SQL server being set to a different time zone and java not knowing it.

If I delete all the entries in the Post model I get an error when I try reference the first item in the post list ordered by date, which I did like this:</p>

<pre><code>latest_post = Post.objects.order_by('-date_created')[0]
</code></pre>

<p>The error is: IndexError: list index out of range</p>

<p>As a fix, I now get the item like this:</p>

<pre><code>all_posts = Post.objects.order_by('-date_created')
latest_post = ()
if (all_posts):
  latest_post = all_posts[0]
</code></pre>

<p>This works if there are no items in my model ""Post"", and no exception is thrown.
However to me this seems like too much code to do something fairly simple. I assume there is a better way to do this using the django QuerySet API, but can't find anything in the documentation.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>EDIT: Strangely, this throws no error when there are no items in the Post model:</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('myApp').constant('gridConfig1', {
    data: 'rac.data',
    primaryKey: 'Id', //may need to make this work to hide the id in the grid.

<p>});</p>

<p>Here is the row template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-class=""{'bg-danger': row.getProperty('insufficientValue') === true}""&gt;
&lt;div ng-repeat=""col in renderedColumns"" ng-class=""col.colIndex()"" class=""ngCell ""&gt;
    &lt;div ng-cell&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>In my view, I have each ng-grid container represented, with an ng-show on each which calls a property on the controller that returns true/false based on the user's role.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""col-md-12""&gt;
            &lt;div class=""gridStyle condensed-table"" ng-grid=""rac.defaultReadOnlyGridConfig"" ng-show=""rac.readOnlyMode""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

<p>Additionally, I have a dropdown that allows the user to switch between certain roles, based on the hierarchical level of that user's role.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=""dropdown-menu"" role=""menu"" ng-show=""rac.superUser""&gt;

                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="""" ng-click=""rac.switchToReadOnlyMode()""&gt;&lt;i class=""fa fa-lock""&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Read Only Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                &lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I switch to a lesser role, the property that would force the other grid to show does so, and the html is rendered in the DOM; however, the grid does not visibly show.</p>

<p>What could I possibly be missing here? Is there a problem with the use of rowTemplates in ng-grid in combination with multiple configurations, and how they are displayed as I have them set up?</p>

<p>Two thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I comment out the row template on either of the other configurations, the default template shows up with no problem.</li>
<li>If I show all of the grids without hiding them based on their visibility property, all are rendered as expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks in advance!!</p>

Mine is a monitoring script so it checks this file every 60s for the pattern KING KING and if it exists I shall put it in a new file for further operations. Now if you see <strong>timestamps</strong> are different.At 10:15 I got the first 2 lines with the matching pattern. Now at 12:46 when I run the script I don't want the previously found Matching Pattern again 
I,e at 12:46 I only want <code>""12:46:55 03/04/2014 No value nothing is there here KING KING ""</code> 
and not again the values at 09:54 and 09:35 (I,e Bon scott and Pink Floyd) So basically how do I use grep/sed/awk to filter only the latest and not give me the old ones. Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>at 10:00 My script runs I grep for KING KING and get the Pink Floyd and Bon Scott lines. Now again (say) at 16:00 My script runs I only want the strings </p>

<pre><code>12:46:55 03/04/2014 No value nothing is there here KING KING
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>15:39:43 03/04/2014 It's all a joker KING KING
</code></pre>

<p>and not the older ones. Please note there can be many occurrences of KING KING pattern not only 2.</p>

Basically I need to compute a checksum for code being written to an EPROM and Iâd like to write this function in an Ada program to practice my bit manipulation in the language.</p>

<p>A section of a firmware data file for an EPROM is being changed by me and that change requires a new valid checksum at the end so the resulting system will accept the changed code.  This checksum starts out by doing a modulo 256 binary sum of all data it covers and then other higher-level operations are done to get the checksum which I wonât go into here.</p>

<p>So now how do I do binary addition on a mod type?  </p>

<p>I assumed if I use the â+â operator on a mod type it would be summed like an integer value operationâ¦a result I donât want.  Iâm really stumped on this one.  I donât want to really do a packed array and perform the bit carry if I donât have to, especially if thatâs considered âold hatâ.  References Iâm reading claim you need to use mod types to ensure more portable code when dealing with binary operations.  Iâd like to try that if itâs possible. I'm trying to target multiple platforms with this program so portability is what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest how I might perform binary addition on a mod type? </p>

<p>Any starting places in the language would be of great help. </p>

<p>I basically want to do some processing and then signal the main thread which is executing in another object that the processing has been done on <code>someData</code> and that it should now access it.</p>

<p>I have attempted wrapping this in a dispatch group like this</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_group_t group = dispatch_group_create();

dispatch_group_async(group,dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH, 0), ^ {
    calendarData = [calender returnCalenderEvents];
});

dispatch_group_notify(group,dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH, 0), ^ {
    NSLog(@""%@"",calendarData);
});
</code></pre>

<p>however since the call is async it still notifies the group of completion before any actual completion has beeen done. </p>

<p>My normal method of development was to open a DB connection at the beginning of a script/page, then do a bunch of <code>mysql_query</code> calls as needed (mostly <code>SELECT</code> and <code>INSERT</code>). I'm using PDO for the first time, and it looks like the practice here is to create distinct PDO objects for each query/transaction. These seems like it would create multiple connections to the same DB during a string, which seems like a lot of unnecessary overhead. </p>

source.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad;
source.CreateOptions = BitmapCreateOptions.IgnoreImageCache;
source.UriSource = new Uri(""C:\\Temp\\tech\\window.jpg"");
source.EndInit();
image.Source = source; // image object automatically initialized in the window construction.
</code></pre>

<p>As you can implicitly see, <code>window.jpg</code> is an image that permanently changed (get deleted and replaced with a new different image <em>with the same name</em>).</p>

<p>I have been using the above mentioned way to initialize the <code>Image</code> object <code>Source</code> property because I have found it at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10518986/image-does-not-refresh-in-custom-picture-box"">Image does not refresh in custom picture box</a> as a way to support the <code>Image</code> refreshing.</p>

<p>However, when deleting and replacing <code>window.jpg</code> while the program is running, the <code>Image</code> object still shows the image that was loaded when we initialized its <code>Source</code> property (cache).</p>

<p>It seems like the <code>Image</code> object ignores the <code>BitmapCreateOptions.IgnoreImageCache</code> value and doesn't refresh the image when a new one replacing the previous that was deleted.</p>

<p>Any solution will be welcomed.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I don't want to change the filename because I would need to redundantly find a random name that doesn't exist instead of just refreshing the image to load the same <code>Source</code> again.</p>

<p>I don't want to change the <code>Source</code> property value because of the fact that I don't change the filename.</p>

<p>The desired solution is to update the  <code>Image</code> object each time the image file changes. The image change controlled by me so there is no need to bind and wait for a change, instead, I would force an image refresh, if it possible.</p>
